# TITLE
Circle Case Study

## Overview and Origin
* Name of company
Circle

* When was the company incorporated?
Circle began their operations in 2013.

* Who are the founders of the company?
Jeremy Allaire is Circle's Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer. 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Circle's business model has continued to evolve. In late 2019, they shifted away from certain consumer facing products, including a digital asset trading platform, to focus on the development and commercialization of USDC at the enterprise level.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Circle has funded their operations since inception primarily through equity financings, convertible notes, and revenue generated by their products and services.
At announcement, Circle’s pro forma enterprise value of $4.5 billion implied a 5.8x multiple of 2023 projected revenue, based on management’s projections, which compares favorably to publicly-traded peer companies.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Circle's mission of raising global economic prosperity through the frictionless exchange of financial value is being met through a series of transaction and treasury services that help businesses and financial institutions globally take advantage of the shift to a digital asset and blockchain powered global financial system.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The total projected long-term global addressable markets for Circle’s offerings are over $165 trillion, comprised of $130 trillion for M2 money supply, $35 trillion for global payments and $2 trillion for cryptocurrency.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Circle recently secured a Class F Digital Asset Business license from the Bermuda Monetary Authority to offer yield-generating services as part of the Circle Account product. Customers with funds in USDC can transfer said USDC from their Circle Account into the yield service product, select a term-length, and receive monthly interest payments. Yield is generated through lending USDC out to centralized blockchain based lending markets.
Circle is also considering pursuing a U.S. national bank charter and/or evaluating the acquisition of a national bank. This would allow Cirlce to access the Federal Reserve System directly, reducing the costs and time for settling transactions.
Circle has also established two relationships for sponsorship in the payment card networks (i.e., Mastercard and Visa).
Circle also intends to provide the technology to allow their customers to effectively connect a Circle wallet to certain decentralized finance protocols.
SeedInvest offers a digital platform for companies to raise capital through equity offerings directly on the internet and seeks to capitalize on interest in the digitization of early-stage investing.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Circle offers a range of products to its customers, including USD Coin (“USDC”) market infrastructure, Circle Transaction and Treasury Services (“TTS”), and SeedInvest.
Circle operates the core market infrastructure for USDC, including the underlying issuance and redemption infrastructure, treasury and liquidity management, and managing the dollar-denominated reserve assets that back USDC in circulation. Transaction and Treasury Services include (1) Circle Account, (2) Circle Yield, and (3) Circle API Services. All three of the services are components of a comprehensive suite of Transaction and Treasury Services to corporations and financial institutions seeking to integrate a dollar digital asset into their commercial and financial needs. Additionally, SeedInvest provides businesses with a platform to raise capital through equity offerings directly on the internet and is one of the largest equity crowdfunding platforms in the U.S.
To receive USDC a customer must deposit, via credit or debit card, ACH or wire transfer, to a Circle bank account, U.S. dollars corresponding to the amount of desired USDC tokens. Once the credit is made to the Circle bank account, USDC tokens are minted and issued to the customer’s digital wallet (the “Circle Account”), effectively increasing the USDC in circulation. Likewise, customers with USDC in their Circle Account can redeem USDC so that the system burns the USDC tokens and transfers U.S. dollar funds out of reserve and into a customer’s linked bank account, effectively reducing the USDC in circulation.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Circle operates as a global financial technology company utilizing open protocols on public blockchains, which means the domain in which they operate in is the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Digital assets and public blockchains have catalyzed change in significant ways, including the storage of value, the transmission of value, the tokenization of value, programmable value, the allocation of capital, and decentralized identities to name a few.
Stablecoins built on blockchain technology were only introduced in 2014 and remain in the early stages of development.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Circle currently competes at multiple levels with a variety of competitors, including:
payment platforms, fiat-backed and algorithmic stablecoins; banks and non-bank financial institutions; digital wallet providers; yield service providers; and crowdfunding and other investing and capital raise platforms.
Competition may include existing bank settlement networks such as SWIFT and ACH, and higher level payment networks such as card payment networks, and new digital payment networks such as Square and PayPal.
With Circle Yield we compete indirectly with other institutional lending products from firms such as BlockFi or BitGo. Direct competitors for some of Circle’s API services include PrimeTrust. SeedInvest faces competition from other startup companies providing similar services, including StartEngine and Republic.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Among other things, Circle's products helps companies efficiently accept and make payments in a digitally-native environment, store value, and gain access to enhanced yield on their investments in digital assets.
In addition to payments and treasury services, Circle helps firms raise capital through direct equity offerings on the internet.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Circle regularly reviews key business metrics including USDC in Circulation, Total Transaction Volume, Total Circle Accounts, Transacting Circle API Customers, Closed Investment Volume, Adjusted EBIDTA, and other measures to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions.
Since the beginning of 2020, USDC has grown by over 65x from $400 million to over $27 billion USDC in circulation as of July 31, 2021.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Circle’s role as co-founding member along with Coinbase, of Centre, Inc., the consortium created to oversee various aspects of the USDC stablecoin, provides Circle with significant advantages over other potential stablecoin issuers.
